### Introduction to Model Training in DEEPSEEK

In this section, we will explore the process of preparing datasets for training within the DEEPSEEK framework. You will learn about data normalization, splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets, and other preprocessing steps.

**Examples:**
- Example of data normalization: scaling features to a range.
- Example of splitting data: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test.

### Implementing Training Routines

This part of the lesson focuses on writing the code to train an AI model. We will cover the selection of learning algorithms, setting up training loops, adjusting hyperparameters, and using DEEPSEEK's API for efficient model training.

**Examples:**
- Implementing a training loop in Python using DEEPSEEK.
- Tuning hyperparameters using grid search methods.

### Evaluation Metrics for AI Models

Learn about different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. Understand which metrics are most suitable for different types of models like classifiers, regressors, and deep neural networks.

**Examples:**
- Calculating precision and recall for a classification task.
- Analyzing AUC-ROC curves for model evaluation.

### Testing and Validation Strategies

In this section, you will learn methods for testing and validating models, including K-fold cross-validation, Leave-One-Out cross-validation, and bootstrapping. Learn how these methods help in assessing model reliability.

**Examples:**
- Implementing K-fold cross-validation with sklearn.
- Using bootstrapping for small datasets.

  - **Hints:** Focus on understanding the scale of your data before applying transformations.
  - **Solutions:** The normalized data should be within the range [-1, 1], and you should have three datasets for training, validation, and testing.

- Training Routine Implementation: Implement a training routine using DEEPSEEK. Train a neural network on a given dataset and document the process.
  - **Hints:** Pay attention to your learning rate and batch size settings for optimal performance.
  - **Solutions:** Look for convergence in training loss and monitor validation loss for signs of overfitting.

- Evaluation Metrics Analysis: Calculate and interpret precision, recall, and F1 score for a classification model that you've trained in the prior exercise.
  - **Hints:** Precision and recall are crucial in evaluating classification tasks beyond accuracy.
  - **Solutions:** Provide calculated metrics and discuss circumstances where each metric provides deeper insights.
