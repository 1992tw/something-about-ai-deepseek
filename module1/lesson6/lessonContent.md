### Introduction to Capstone Project Work

In this lesson, you will begin your capstone project, which serves as a culmination of the learning in this module. We will guide you through the initial phases of your project, including conceptualization, problem definition, and team collaboration.

**Examples:**
- Develop a project proposal that identifies a specific problem in healthcare that can be addressed using AI DEEPSEEK.
- Create a flowchart outlining the steps needed to apply AI DEEPSEEK to improve financial decision-making processes.

### Defining the Problem Statement

A clear problem statement is crucial for the success of your project. It guides your research, informs your methodology, and grounds your work in real-world applicability. Use the experiences and techniques from previous weeks to craft your statement.

**Examples:**
- Example of a well-defined problem statement: 'Develop an AI model using DEEPSEEK to predict patient readmission rates in hospitals based on historical data.'

### Planning Your Project

Planning involves setting clear goals, defining scope, assigning roles, and establishing timelines. A Gantt chart or a project timeline should align with the objectives and strategies you've learned.

**Examples:**
- Draft a timeline that includes milestones for data collection, model training, and final presentation.
- Use team meetings to outline the roles of each member, e.g., data preparation, model implementation, and result analysis.
